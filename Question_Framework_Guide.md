# Question Framework Guide

## Strategic Questioning Principles

**Move Beyond Surface Level**: Instead of asking "What's your tone?", ask "When you communicate with your audience, what psychological relationship are you trying to establish? Are you the trusted advisor, the challenging mentor, or the peer who's figured something out?"

**Uncover Frameworks**: Rather than "What are your values?", ask "When you're making difficult decisions under pressure, what principles guide your choices? Can you describe a specific situation where these principles were tested?"

**Activate Cognitive Patterns**: Instead of "How do you write?", ask "What emotional state does your ideal reader need to be in when they finish consuming your content? How do you systematically create that state?"

## Profile-Specific Question Frameworks

### Personal Profile Deep Discovery

**Identity & Philosophy**
- "Describe a moment when you had to choose between what was safe and what felt aligned with who you're becoming. What drove that decision?"
- "What beliefs about success, growth, or achievement do you hold that most people in your field would disagree with?"
- "When you're in peak performance state, what mental models or frameworks are you unconsciously running?"

**Decision-Making Architecture**
- "Walk me through how you made your most important recent decision. What data did you gather? What did you ignore? What felt 'right' even if it didn't make logical sense?"
- "What patterns do you notice in your decision-making when you're under pressure versus when you have time to think?"
- "What types of decisions do you make purely on instinct, and which ones require analysis?"

**Emotional & Energy Framework**
- "How do you systematically use emotions as fuel for performance rather than letting them derail you?"
- "What specific environments, people, or activities consistently drain your energy versus amplify it?"
- "When you're designing your ideal day, what energy patterns are you optimizing for?"

### Brand Voice Deep Discovery

**Psychological Relationship Design**
- "When someone reads your content, what shift in their thinking or emotional state are you trying to create?"
- "What authority position are you claiming with your audience? Expert, peer, guide, challenger, or something else?"
- "How do you want people to feel about themselves after engaging with your content?"

**Persuasion Architecture**
- "What unconscious objections or resistance patterns does your audience have that your communication style needs to address?"
- "Which persuasion principles (social proof, authority, scarcity, etc.) align with your authentic personality and which feel manipulative?"
- "How does your communication style differ when you're educating versus when you're selling?"

**Language & Cognitive Activation**
- "What specific words or phrases create instant credibility with your audience versus immediate skepticism?"
- "How sophisticated is your audience's understanding of your topic? Do you need to educate up or challenge existing assumptions?"
- "What reference points, metaphors, or frameworks does your audience already understand that you can build upon?"

### Business Context Deep Discovery

**Strategic Positioning**
- "What problem do you solve that no one else solves in exactly the same way? What's your unique mechanism or approach?"
- "Who are you specifically NOT trying to serve, and why? What types of clients or customers would dilute your positioning?"
- "What industry assumptions or conventional wisdom do you deliberately reject or do differently?"

**Value Creation Architecture**
- "How do you systematically create results for clients that they couldn't achieve on their own?"
- "What's the transformation journey you take clients through? What do they believe, know, or feel at each stage?"
- "What capabilities or assets do you have that create unfair advantages in delivering results?"

**Growth & Constraint Framework**
- "What would need to be true for you to 10x your business without fundamentally changing what makes it valuable?"
- "What constraints (time, team, systems) currently limit your growth, and which ones are you choosing to maintain for strategic reasons?"
- "How do you systematically say no to opportunities that don't align with your strategic direction?"

### Marketing Strategy Deep Discovery

**Customer Psychology Mapping**
- "What emotional journey does someone need to go through before they're ready to buy from you?"
- "What beliefs or assumptions does your target customer need to let go of before they can see the value in your solution?"
- "How does your customer's readiness to buy change based on external factors (economic conditions, industry trends, personal circumstances)?"

**Funnel Psychology Design**
- "At each stage of your funnel, what specific psychological shift needs to happen for someone to move to the next stage?"
- "What proof points or evidence does your audience need to see before they trust you enough to engage?"
- "How do you systematically build desire and urgency without creating pressure or resistance?"

**Channel Strategy Framework**
- "Which marketing channels allow you to demonstrate your unique value most effectively?"
- "How does your message need to adapt across different channels while maintaining core positioning?"
- "What's your philosophy on organic relationship building versus paid acceleration?"

### Ideal Customer Profile Deep Discovery

**Psychological Profiling**
- "When your ideal customer is lying awake at 3am worried about their business/life, what specific thoughts are keeping them up?"
- "What does success look like to them? Not just business metrics, but how they want to feel about themselves and their achievements?"
- "What past experiences or failures have shaped how they make decisions in your category?"

**Behavioral Pattern Analysis**
- "How does your ideal customer typically research and evaluate solutions in your space?"
- "What role do they play in the decision-making process? Are they the recommender, influencer, or final decision-maker?"
- "What other purchases or investments are they making that signal they're ready for your solution?"

**Trust & Authority Mapping**
- "What credentials, experiences, or proof points immediately establish credibility with your ideal customer?"
- "Who do they already trust for advice in your domain? What do those trusted sources have in common?"
- "What would make them immediately skeptical of you or your solution?"

## Advanced Questioning Techniques

**The Contrast Method**: "Describe someone who's exactly the opposite of your ideal customer. What do they believe, value, or prioritize differently?"

**The Pressure Test**: "When you're under extreme pressure or stress, how do these patterns change? What remains consistent?"

**The Evolution Probe**: "How have these patterns evolved over the last 2-3 years? What's driving the change?"

**The Exception Analysis**: "When don't these patterns apply? What situations cause you to behave completely differently?"

**The Framework Extraction**: "If you had to teach someone else to make decisions the way you do, what's the system or framework you'd give them?"

## Question Quality Standards

**Depth Indicators**: Good questions should uncover frameworks, patterns, psychological drivers, and strategic context rather than preferences or surface characteristics.

**Specificity Requirements**: Questions should demand specific examples, situations, or scenarios rather than allowing general or abstract responses.

**Framework Activation**: Questions should help the person articulate their unconscious patterns and decision-making architectures.

**Strategic Context**: Questions should reveal the "why" behind choices and the strategic thinking that drives behavior.

**Unique Positioning**: Questions should uncover what makes this person, brand, or business distinctly different from alternatives in their space.
