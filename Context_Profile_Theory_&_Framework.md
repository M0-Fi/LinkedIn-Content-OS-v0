# Context Profile Theory & Framework

## The Knowledge Activation Principle

Large language models contain layered knowledge databases trained on millions of expert conversations, academic papers, case studies, and real-world applications. The context profile determines which layers get activated.

**Generic profile**: Activates shallow, commonly repeated advice
**Specific profile**: Activates deep, specialized knowledge patterns that most people never access

## The 4-Level Framework for Profile Depth

**Level 1: Job Title** - "marketing expert" (surface knowledge)
**Level 2: Specialized Function** - "conversion rate optimization specialist" (deeper expertise)  
**Level 3: Context + Constraints** - "CRO specialist for B2B SaaS companies with 6-month sales cycles" (targeted knowledge)
**Level 4: Specific Achievement** - "CRO specialist who improved trial-to-paid conversion for enterprise SaaS from 12% to 34% using behavioral psychology" (expert-level patterns)

## Cognitive Architecture Design

Instead of generic roles, engineer specific cognitive architectures that activate precise knowledge databases:

**AI-Last Brain**: "you are a marketing expert"
**AI-First Brain**: "you are a conversion psychologist who understands the hidden cognitive triggers that make B2B decision-makers take action during economic uncertainty"

The second role activates:
- Psychology knowledge (cognitive triggers, decision-making patterns)
- B2B expertise (longer sales cycles, multiple stakeholders)
- Economic context (uncertainty, risk aversion, budget constraints)
- Conversion focus (action-oriented, results-driven thinking)

## Creative Role Combinations

Combine multiple expertise areas to create unique knowledge intersections:
- "Behavioral economist who applies game theory to SaaS pricing strategy"
- "Former Navy SEAL turned productivity consultant who designs systematic approaches for high-stress decision making"
- "Neuroscientist who studies attention patterns and applies them to content design for busy executives"

## Domain-Specific Activation Techniques

**Technical domains**: Specify tools, methodologies, frameworks
**Creative domains**: Specify style influences, aesthetic approaches  
**Business domains**: Specify constraints, context, success metrics

## Profile Design Standards

**What makes profiles effective:**
- Specific enough to activate deep knowledge
- Broad enough to maintain strategic thinking
- Include psychological frameworks and decision-making patterns
- Capture unique positioning and differentiation factors
- Provide strategic context and constraints

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Too broad: "business expert" → activates generic business advice
- Too narrow: "Facebook ads specialist" → misses strategic context
- No context: "sales coach" → doesn't specify industry, deal size, sales model
- No constraints: "content creator" → doesn't specify audience, platform, goals

## The Sweet Spot

Specific enough to activate deep knowledge, broad enough to maintain strategic thinking. The profile should unlock expertise combinations that don't exist in any single expert but emerge from the intersection of different domains.
